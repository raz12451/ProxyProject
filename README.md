## Synopsis

ProjectProxy is a project i made for an easy way to hide yourself by using pretty "trusted" proxies.
the project involves 3 projects:

####Browser

a speical browser which connect to a proxy you control, otherwise , if it can't find one, connect through regular wifi/DSL/3G.

####Client

the client which gets all the proxies from your controlled machines.

####Server

the infected servers which transfer its computer to the proxy server. inclueded is automated self installation (bad-usb) and a code for the bad-us itself.

## Motivation

for fun and experince

## Installation

run the browser, which autoamtically runs the client.
in addition you need to have an infected machine to run this.
to do it you need to instal the server and the automated self installation onto the usb.
then just run the browser and you have your own private browser!.
